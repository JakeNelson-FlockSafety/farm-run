How to run the game

**1. Get the Tools**
* **Install Xcode**(free from the Mac App Store).
    * This is Apple’s official IDE for iOS/macOS development. It comes with:
        * A code editor
        * UI builder
        * iPhone/iPad simulator
        * Build & debugging tools
* Install Xcode Command Line Tools (they usually come with Xcode, but you can check with in Terminal).

**2. Set Up Your Developer Account**
* Apple ID: You can build & run apps on your iPhone for free using your regular Apple ID.
* Apple Developer Program ($99/year): Needed only if you want to publish on the App Store or access advanced features (like TestFlight for beta testing, push notifications, in-app purchases).

**3. Create Your First App**
1. Open Xcode → File > New > Project.
2. Choose iOS > App.
3. Name it (e.g., HelloWorld).
4. Select Interface: SwiftUI (modern, declarative UI) or Storyboard (older, drag-and-drop). SwiftUI is recommended.
5. Language: Swift (primary iOS language).
6. Run it in the Simulator (e.g., iPhone 15 Pro).

**4. Run on Your iPhone**
1. Connect your iPhone via USB (or Wi-Fi if enabled).
2. In Xcode, select your iPhone as the run target.
3. The first time, you’ll need to trust your developer certificate:
    * On iPhone: Settings > General > VPN & Device Management > Developer App → Trust.
4. Hit Run ▶ and see your app on your phone!
